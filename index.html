      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Briana Kirkman and I am a
        <strong>3rd year computer Science</strong> student. In addition to my
        interest in CS, I also really love performing arts. I am in the Cal Poly
        Symphony orchestra and the United Movement Performance and Compettiton
        team. I started both of these hobbies when I was 6.

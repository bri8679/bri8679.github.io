            My name is Briana Kirkman and I am a
            <strong>3rd year computer Science</strong> student. In addition to
            my interest in CS, I also really love performing arts. I am in the
            Cal Poly Symphony orchestra and the United Movement Performance and
            Compettiton team. I started both of these hobbies when I was 6.
